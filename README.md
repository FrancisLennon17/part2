...ran out of time.

## Linting & Code Formatting

| Command              | Description                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `npm run lint`       | ESLint the codebase                     |

## Tech Debt / Todo

- share `Book` interface between repos (various options: another repo/graphql)
- Expand/document `.env` file (optional)
- Dockerise
- Add graphql, and ability to browse books by subject.
- Add router, so specific books can be accessed directly.
- Theme (define colour pallette etc.)
