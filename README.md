We have intentionally left these requirements relatively vague to see your approach. 

Part 1 – Back End

Clone this repository and make a pull request with the following content
https://github.com/FrancisLennon17/part1

Create a Rest API in NodeJS (with Typescript) that contains 3 endpoints.
1.	fetch a list of books.
2.	Fetch a list of authors
3.	update a book

The books should come from a JSON file, that contains 10 books. The fetch endpoint should be filterable by author.
